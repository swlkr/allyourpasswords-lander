      <p>
        Hey ðŸ‘‹

        My name is Sean
      </p>

      <p>
        and I like to make apps in my spare time.
      </p>

      <p>
        I was using my existing offline password manager happily until one day I felt like I was being forced into the cloud! No!
      </p>

      <p>
        There was just one thing left to do. Make yet another password manager. I should also mention I have severe NIH syndrome.
      </p>

      <p>
        Of course, I wasn't going to just make it, I was going to make it little by little every day for a month. It also happened to be
        January 1st 2019. There isn't a better time to start something new than that.

      </p>

        I made a little more progress until the 30th when it was time to launch a very humble v1.</a>
      </p>

      <p>
        That's the story of how allyourpasswords came to be.
